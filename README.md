# Gammakorrektur - Project Assignment for Computer Architecture Lab (In German)

This project addresses the implementation of an algorithm for gamma correction in image processing. The algorithm converts a color image to grayscale and subsequently performs gamma correction. The implementation is done in C following the C17 standard. For more information please read "Vortrag.pdf" and "Ausarbeitung.pdf
